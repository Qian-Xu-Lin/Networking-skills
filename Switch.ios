!Port Security Violation Modes
            switchport port-security violation {  protect | restrict |  shutdown}
        shutdown: the default, port enters the error-disabled state, turns off port LED and sends syslog
        !must be re-enabled bu shutdown and no shutdown cmds
        restrict: drop packets with unknown source addresses until mac value isnt maxed out (by either device dropping ou or increasing max value)
        !The security violation count increases and generates a syslog
        protect : least secure: drop packets with unknown source addresses until mac value isnt maxed out (by either device dropping ou or increasing max value)
        !no syslog is sent 
    
!Mitigate VLAN hopping attacks: steps have alreasy been taken: i.e not using vlan 1, swictport mode access, no dtp

!in trusted (most likely internal) ports enable snooping and DAI
    interface (range) f0/X

        ip arp inspection trust
!Limit the number of DHCP discovery messages that can be received per second on untrusted ports
    interface range f0/ not trusted
        ip dhcp snooping limit rate 1-500 (lower is more secure) 
!Enable DHCP snooping and DAI by VLAN, or by a range of VLANs
        exit
    ip dhcp snooping vlan x,x-x
    ip arp inspection vlan x, x-x

!if using multiple all on the same line or else overwrite
